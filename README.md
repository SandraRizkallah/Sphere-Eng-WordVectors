# Sphere-Eng-WordVectors
The file "Sphere-Eng-WordVectors50.txt" contains 27770 vectors for English words. The vector dimension is 50.
The vectors are generated using a new approach. The approach is based on embedding the word vectors into a sphere, whereby the dot product between any vectors represents the similarity.
The file is organized as follows: each line contains the word followed by its vector where the vector's elements are comma delimited.
